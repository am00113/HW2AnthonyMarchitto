## Project Overview
For my project I wanted to create a website that has important information for ski resorts like weather, snowfall, and trail maps. 
Currently I have a basic homepage and a page that includes a table that has basic info about two ski resorts in West Virginia and their respective trail maps.

## Page Descriptions
I want my homepage to be a landing point for users that describes what the website is as well as maybe having a search bar in the future.
So far it has a link to my second page about ski resorts in West Virginia. My second page has a table that includes resorts in WV 
and images for those resorts.

## Research Summary
#### Website #1: AccuWeather

In this website you can type in your address, city or zip code into a search bar and it will give you the weather for the area you provided. 
The website has a main theme of white, black, and orange and the webpages and all the weather images follow this theme. 
This website uses div tags a lot to divide the weather information and it also uses a tags when you click on the temperature to redirect you to a new page. 
One tag that I do not recognize is the span tag. For my website I would want to emulate the way that the website finds the weather for a provided location.

#### Website #2: OnTheSnow

This website has a lot of things that I would like to have in my website. 
For example, it has the snow reports for ski resorts in the United States and it also has reviews and ratings for each of them as well. 
This website uses the table and td tag to create a table that has ski resorts and information about them like snowfall, depth, and open lifts. 
Something that I didn’t recognize was the iframe tag. 

#### Website #3: SkiCentral

This website divides the country into different regions and allows you to look at ski resorts in those regions. 
If you click on one of the states the website lists the resorts in that state but also includes pictures of the ski trails as well. 
It also has a snow report on each resort and has a pie chart showing the number of trails and their difficulty. 
One thing that I didn’t recognize was the canvas tag, which was used on the pie chart. 
The pie charts also used bootstrap to format how they looked as well.

#### Repository #1: https://github.com/PritamSarbajna/simple-weather-website?tab=readme-ov-file

This repository includes a basic weather page that allows a user to input a location and it will return basic weather info. 
The repo also includes a readme that has pictures and a preview of the website. They use an API to get the weather data that is 
displayed on the website and a search bar and a button that has an icon on it.

#### Repository #2: https://github.com/scottpdawson/ski-resort-finder

This repository has a website that is a map based ski resort finder. They use an interactable map that has ski resorts around 
the country marked on it. If you click on a resort it shows you the elevation, number of lifts, and other information. 
In the repository I found that they use a ski map API that has a collection of ski maps from around the 
country which might be something that I can use.

## Future Enhancements
In the future I would like to add more pages for different states and locations around the world. I would also like to add more
resorts to my existing page as well. I would also like to add a search bar where a user could input a state or zip code and the application
will direct them to a resort where they specified. I would also like to have a page for each resort that I add that will have a image
of the trail map as well as some basic weather information like temperature and the amount of snow.

## Reflection on Resources
The main resource that I used for this assignment was w3schools. This was the best resource for when I needed to figure out how
to do certain things with html code or javascript. Another resource that I found helpful was ChatGPT. I mainly used this to figure
out syntax for markdown as well as previewing what my readme file would look like before committing it to the repo.
